I can create a VPC on mutliple regions.{FALSE}

I interconnect 2 VPCs using... {
=Route tables in each VPC target a VPC peering.
=EC2 instances running VPN software. Those instances must be the default route for the VPC.
=A transit Gateway attached to my VPCs. Route tables of the VPCs and Transit Gateway must contain the correct rules.
}

With Transit Gateway I can interconnect easily many VPC because...{
  =I can centrally manage the routing
  ~I can interconnect VPCs with overlapping CIDRs
  ~AWS is magical
}

A subnet is created inside an availability zone. If I want HA...{
  ~I specify a parameter `HA` during the subnet creation.
 =I must create several subnets. Each in different availability zones
 =I must create several subnets. At least in 2 availability zones
}

// public accessebility
Match the following use case with the best setup. {
  =I need to guarantee instances in my VPC will not access Internet -> no internet gateway
  =I need to guarantee private instances in my VPC will not be accessed from Internet  -> instances are in private subnet (without public IP). An Internet gateway is a target for default route in the public route tables. A nat gateway is a target for the default route in the private route table.
  =I need to guarantee private instances in my VPC will not be accessed from Internet AND will not access Internet -> instances are in private subnet (without public IP). An Internet gateway is a target for default route in the public route tables.
}

// DX and VPN
I can backup a Direct Connect with a VPN connection?{TRUE}

Direct connect is preferred to VPN because latency and bandwith are more stable compared to the performance of a VPN?{TRUE}

// ENI is
An Elastic Network Interface is...{
  ~An IPV4 private address I can attach to different subnets
  ~An IPV4 private address with changing MAC address
  =An IPV4 private address I can attach/detach to/of non-primay interfaces of EC2 instances
  =An IPV4 private address created inside a subnet
}

// SG and ACL
Security groups and Network ACL are 2 mechanisms to secure Ã  VPC?{TRUE}

Which assertion is false?{
  =NACL are stafull and security groups
  ~Security groups are firewall configuration at ENI level
  ~NACL are firewall configuration at subnet level
}
// VPC endpoints
A VPC endpoints is usefull to avoid using Internet Connectivity to join AWS services from instances inside a VPC?{TRUE}

A VPC endpoints is usefull to call a service endpoint created in another AWS VPC inside another AWS account?{TRUE}

// ELB types
Match the following use description with each type of load balancer. {
  =Application Load Balancer can -> perform HTTP/HTTPS traffic inspection to route to specific targets
  =Network Load Balancer can -> handle millions of requests per second with a single IP per availability zone
  =Classic Load Balancer can -> perform HTTP/HTTPS traffic inspection and also TCP, but should be avoid
